>just understanding the concept and transform it into lines of code

I really like watching Walter Lewin's lecture. so to commemorate his greatness as an educator, i made this lines of code that can effectively do its thing.

Key takeaways:
The simulation runs that is dependent to the input parameters
The initial conditions are set with the user and zero initial angular velocity
The Runge-Kutta 4th Order Method is used for numerical integration to solve the ODEs.


enjoy!
